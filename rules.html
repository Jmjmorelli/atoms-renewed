		<h1>Rules of the game</h1>
		<p><a href=".">Play!</a></p>
		<ol id="rules">
			<li>The game is played on a board consisting of several (initially empty) cells.</li>
			<li>Every player has a distinct color.</li>
			<li>Players take turns; each turn, a player must place an atom of his color to the game board.</li>
			<li>Atoms can be placed either to an empty cell, or to a cell which already contains your color.</li>
			<li>Every cell can contain a maximum of atoms equal to the number of its neighbors (4-side neighborhood).</li>
			<li>When the amount of atoms in a cell exceeds that cell's maximum, the cell explodes: one atom jumps to every neighbor.</li>
			<li>Jumping atoms instantly re-color all atoms in target cell to their own color.</li>
			<li>Player owning all cells on the board wins.</li>
